The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of an ecommerce business’s sales, including visualizations of sales trends, customer demographics, top-performing products, and profitability. It allows users to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven decisions.

# **Key Features**:

## **Sales Overview**:

Visualizes important KPIs like Total Revenue, Total Orders, and the number of Unique Customers.
Includes calculated measures like Average Order Value (AOV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), giving a quick overview of business health.

## **Sales Trends**:

Line charts and area charts showing daily, monthly, and yearly sales trends, making it easy to monitor performance over time.
Time-based filters allow users to adjust the view to a specific time frame, helping to focus on relevant trends.

## **Top-Selling Products**:

A ranked list of the top-performing products based on total revenue and units sold.
Helps identify best-selling items, as well as products that might need more focus or marketing efforts.

## **Customer Demographics**:

Insights into the geographic distribution of customers, including sales by country/region.
Helps analyze which regions contribute the most to overall sales and which regions could be further targeted for marketing campaigns.

## **Profitability Analysis**:

Analyzes gross profit, profit margins, and cost distribution across products.
Helps businesses understand their most profitable product categories and customer segments.

## **Sales by Category & Channel**:

Breaks down sales by product categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) and by sales channels (online, retail stores, etc.).
Offers insights into which categories or sales platforms are driving the most revenue.

## **Interactive Filtering**:

Power BI’s slicers allow users to filter the data by specific criteria such as time periods, product categories, and customer regions.
Enables in-depth and customized analysis without overwhelming the user with unnecessary data.
